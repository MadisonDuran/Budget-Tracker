# Budget-Tracker
This is my budget tracker that helps keep track of the user's income and expenses all in one place. I wanted it be simple to use and have a clean look to it. You can add your income and expenses, get updates quickly, remove expenses, and you can reset the tracker if you want to start from a clean slate.

# How to use
- When you first open the Budget Tracker, everything starts at $0. If you want to set your starting budget, type a short description (like "Paycheck" or "Gift" or any input you'd like) in the "Add Budget" section, put in the amount, and click the button.

- For expenses, do the same thing in "Add Expense" section, add a short description (like "Groceries" or "Rent" or any input you would like) and put the amount you spent.

- The totals at the top will update instantly so you can see how much you have left. If you made a mistake, you just hit the "Remove" button next to the expense, or click "Reset All" if you want to start fresh.
